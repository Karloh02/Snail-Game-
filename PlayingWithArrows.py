#The main idea of this code is to do a game of snail using only python.
#This has beem made by billion people, however I think this is a great opportunity to improve my skills 
#The code must have: 
  #- Record the last position of the snail
  #- Record the last movement made
  #- Have a scoring system
  #- Detect colisions with boundarys and the snail itself
  #- Have the fruits that extend the snail lenght
  #- The movement made by the arrow keys on the computer
  #- Every movement will not be live -> It willl have an iterval of arround 1 second between each movement then it will continue or register the new movement. 
#With this work made, I will try to implement tis game to a discord bot, where the game will be played on discord chat.
